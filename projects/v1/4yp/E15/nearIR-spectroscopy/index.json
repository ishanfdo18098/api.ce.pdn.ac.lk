    "description": " Near-Infrared spectroscopy is used for better vein visualization to make the venipuncture process more efficient. It is usually a painful and time-consuming process and its difficulty increases with the dark skin tones, obesity of patients, and several other health and physical conditions.  Although near-IR spectroscopy is identified as a good solution, its usage is limited to availability, high cost, and doubts about accuracy. The cost of each of these products is very high and not affordable especially in countries like ours. We have implemented a mechanism for better accuracy and lower risk, using an illumination system that favors Asian skin types, while reducing the cost of the device so that it is more affordable especially for common clinical use in countries like ours.",
